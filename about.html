                        <p>
                            International Foundation for Disability Inclusion (IFDI - USA) is a newly registered
                            501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in California, established as an international extension of
                            the India Inclusion Foundation (IIF). Taking inspiration from the work and learnings of IIF
                            over the last decade, we have set up the International Foundation for Disability Inclusion
                            to take this work to a global platform. For over a decade, IIF has been at the forefront of
                            advocating for the inclusion of persons with disabilities (PWD) in India. Its work has
                            spanned creating awareness, organizing impactful programs, and building strong collaborative
                            networks with corporates, nonprofits, and government bodies. Recognizing the need to scale
                            this impact and respond to deeper systemic challenges, IIF has launched IFDI - USA to focus
                            on research, policy advocacy, and international partnerships that can drive long-term,
                            meaningful change.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The journey of the India Inclusion Foundation began in 2012 with the India Inclusion Summit
                            (IIS). Early inclusion efforts within the corporate sector laid the foundation for the
                            annual IIS. Over the past 12 years, IIS has grown into a world-class, community-driven
                            platform for conversations and action around inclusion. Through this platform, IIF has
                            reached more than 18 million online viewers and engaged over 10,000 in-person participants,
                            bringing together policymakers, corporate leaders, civil society organizations, and unsung
                            heroes working in the disability space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Building on this strong foundation, IIF has expanded into initiatives such as the Inclusive
                            Walkathon, Art for Inclusion, the Inclusion Fellowship, and media advocacy campaigns. These
                            programs create platforms for persons with disabilities to share their talent and stories,
                            raise awareness, and push for a deeper shift in how disability is viewed and understood.
                            Despite these efforts, major challenges remain, especially in the implementation of the
                            Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (RPWDA), 2016. Inaccessible infrastructure, gaps in
                            inclusive education, and limited employment opportunities continue to affect millions of
                            people across the country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The establishment of IFDI USA marks an important step toward addressing these challenges at
                            a global level. The organization's mission is to drive systemic change through research,
                            policy advocacy, and international collaboration. By learning from global best practices and
                            building cross-border partnerships, IFDI aims to strengthen disability inclusion efforts and
                            develop scalable models that can be adapted in different social and policy contexts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            IFDI's primary focus will be on research and knowledge creation to better understand the
                            everyday barriers faced by persons with disabilities. The foundation plans to initiate
                            studies on disability-related policies, social attitudes, and access to education and
                            employment. These studies will lead to practical recommendations for policymakers, corporate
                            leaders, and community organizations. Alongside research, IFDI will work to amplify the
                            voices of persons with disabilities through advocacy, storytelling initiatives, and digital
                            platforms, shifting the narrative from sympathy to empathy, dignity, and rights.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            IFDI will actively seek partnerships with universities, nonprofits, and corporates to
                            co-develop research, share knowledge, and implement inclusive practices on the ground.
                            Through these collaborations, the foundation aims to build a global network of institutions
                            and individuals committed to advancing disability inclusion. IFDI also plans to convene
                            international summits and conferences that bring together thought leaders, practitioners,
                            and persons with disabilities to share experiences, showcase successful models, and inspire
                            collective action.
