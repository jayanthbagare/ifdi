                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The Journalism Fellowship on Disability Inclusion is a six-month programme by the International Foundation for Disability Inclusion (IFDI) that supports independent, rights-based, long-form journalism on disability in India.</p>
                <br/>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The fellowship is designed to shift how disability is reported from charity and welfare narratives to dignity, justice, rights, and accountability. Fellows will investigate systemic barriers faced by persons with disabilities across sectors such as education, employment, healthcare, social protection, and access to justice.</p>
                <br/>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Each cohort supports up to 10 journalists, who receive financial support, mentorship, editorial guidance, and capacity-building to produce three original, long-form investigative stories in English.</p>

                <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4 border-b-2 border-brand-green pb-2 inline-block">Background & Rationale</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">India is home to over 26.8 million persons with disabilities (Census 2011), though the actual number is likely higher due to underreporting, social stigma, and limited access to diagnosis. PWDs in India continue to face structural and social exclusion in areas such as education, employment, healthcare, housing, transportation, and digital access. Despite several legal protections including the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016 implementation remains uneven, and public awareness is alarmingly low.</p>
                <br/>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">While many journalists and media organizations in India have taken significant steps to highlight issues of disability, there remains a need to deepen and diversify the coverage—especially from a rights-based, intersectional, and policy-oriented perspective. With this fellowship, we aim to support and nurture a dedicated cohort of journalists whose work focuses specifically on the experiences of persons with disabilities. These stories will explore the intersection of disability with health, education, employment, social justice, and regional disparities—bringing forth perspectives often overlooked in mainstream discourse. The fellowship seeks to complement ongoing efforts by amplifying such narratives and creating a sustained, inclusive media ecosystem around disability rights.</p>

                <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4 border-b-2 border-brand-green pb-2 inline-block">The Need</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">There is an urgent need to foster a new generation of journalists who understand disability not as a medical condition, but as a matter of rights, dignity, and social justice. This fellowship is an attempt to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <br/>
                  <li><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">•	Create space for long-form, investigative, and impactful stories that capture the lived realities of the disability community.</p></li>
                  <br/>
                  <li><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">•	Document and amplify stories from underserved geographies and intersectional identities—Dalit, Adivasi, Muslim, women, and LGBTQ+ PWDs.</p></li>
                  <br/>
                  <li><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">•	Bridge the gap between journalism and policy by enabling evidence-based storytelling that can influence public understanding and advocacy.</p></li>
                  <br/>
                  <li><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">•	Support journalists with mentorship, editorial guidance, and financial resources to pursue independent, public-interest journalism.</p></li>

Aside from reporting and commenting on national and socio-economic issues, Sangeeta's journalistic and writing interest lies in India's Northeast, the region she is native to. A winner of the Ramnath Goenka Excellence in Journalism Award for feature writing 2017, she was the first woman to win the Parag Kumar Das Journalism Award, the highest recognition for stellar reporting on Assam in 2023.
In 2019, she published her first book, Assam: The Accord, The Discord. Brought out by Penguin Random House, the book received critical acclaim for its ability to offer a deep dive into Assam's citizenship issue which had triggered the controversial update process of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). In 2024, her book was cited extensively by a Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court while upholding the validity of Clause 6A of the Citizenship Act.
In 2023, she published her second non-fiction, The Assamese — A Portrait of a Community, a first-of-its-kind collation in English of the history, culture and identity of the people of Assam, the largest social group in the Northeast. Brought out by Aleph Book Company, the book has been widely appreciated, both in Assam and outside of it, for filling up a much-needed gap.
Sangeeta's writings have been published in anthologies like Hope Behind Bars: Notes From Indian Prisons (Pan Macmillan) and But I Am One of You: Northeast India and the Struggle to Belong (HarperCollins India). She is currently writing her third solo non-fiction on her home state Assam, to be published by Penguin Random House in 2026.">
